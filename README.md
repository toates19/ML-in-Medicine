# ML-in-Medicine
This repo contains the slides and (very clunky) code used to make the slide figures from my talk at #LDNephroTx 2019.
The figures are reproduced from Danilo Bzdok, Martin Krzywinski & Naomi Altman's paper in Nature Methods. https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4526
Feedback on slides and code (especially maximising use of lists) is welcome

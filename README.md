# ML-in-Medicine
This repo contains talks from #LDNephroTx 2019 & my visit to the Oxford Kidney Unit, and the (very clunky) code used to make the slide figures. The figures are reproduced from Danilo Bzdok, Martin Krzywinski & Naomi Altman's paper in Nature Methods. https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4526

Feedback on slides and code (especially maximising use of lists) is welcome.

I think all necessary acknowledgments are in the slides but let me know if I've missed anything.
